# Experiment Environment
Our experiments are conducted on Python 3.10 and CUDA 12.2, with the following package dependencies:

```
torch==1.13.1            # core deep learning framework
dgl==1.1.3               # graph neural network library
torch-geometric==2.4.0   # PyG for deploying GNNs
ogb==1.3.6               # for Arxiv and Products datasets
dgllife==0.3.2           # molecular property prediction support
progressbar2             # visualization of training progress
```
